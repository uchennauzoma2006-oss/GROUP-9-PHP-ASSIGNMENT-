# Student
Management System



 



## 🧩 Project Overview



The Online Course
Enrollment Portal is a simple PHP-MySQL web application designed to help
students enroll in courses and allow administrators to manage available
courses.



It demonstrates
fundamental concepts in web development such as:



 



PHP form handling
using GET and POST methods



 



Database
integration with MySQL



 



Prevention of
duplicate enrollments



 



Basic admin panel
and dashboard



 



## ⚙ Setup Instructions



1.) Prerequisites



 



XAMPP



 installed (for Apache & MySQL)



 



Web browser
(e.g., Chrome or Edge)



 



Basic text editor
(VS Code, Sublime)



 



2.) Steps to Run
the Project



 



Start XAMPP



 



Turn on both
Apache and MySQL



 



Create Database



 



Go to
http://localhost/phpMyAdmin



 



Click New →
course.Enrollment



 



Import the
provided file:



course.enrollment.sql



(This creates all
tables: students, courses, enrollments)



 



Move the Project
Folder



 



Copy the project
folder (e.g., Group9_Enrollment_Portal) into



C:\xampp\htdocs\



 



Access the App



 



In your browser,
open



 http://localhost/courseEnrollment.Portal/



 



### 🧩 STEP 2:

## 🔄 Workflow



- Each member
worked on one module of the project.



- Tasks were
shared equally based on difficulty.



- All members
collaborated through a shared folder and group discussions.



- After coding,
we integrated and tested everything together.



 



## Workflow
Summary



 1. Enrollment Form



 



Students use a
POST form to enroll into a selected course.



 



The form data
(student ID, course ID, semester) is sent to enroll.php.



 



PHP validates
input and checks for duplicate enrollments.



 



 2. Viewing Enrollments



 



Admin or students
can view enrolled courses using a GET request.



 



For example:



 



view.php?student_id=1
→ shows all courses for that student.



 



 3. Admin Panel



 



Admin can add,
edit, or delete courses in the admin.php page.



 



Courses stored in
the courses table are reflected automatically in the enrollment form.



 



 4. Dashboard



 



The dashboard.php
shows a summary of:



 



Total students



 



Total courses



 



Total
enrollments.
