# Student Management System

## ðŸ§© Project Overview
The Online Course Enrollment Portal is a simple PHP-MySQL web application designed to help students enroll in courses and allow administrators to manage available courses.
It demonstrates fundamental concepts in web development such as:

PHP form handling using GET and POST methods

Database integration with MySQL

Prevention of duplicate enrollments

Basic admin panel and dashboard

## ðŸ”„ Workflow
- Each member worked on one module of the project.
- Tasks were shared equally based on difficulty.
- All members collaborated through a shared folder and group discussions.
- After coding, we integrated and tested everything together.

## Workflow Summary
 1. Enrollment Form

Students use a POST form to enroll into a selected course.

The form data (student ID, course ID, semester) is sent to enroll.php.

PHP validates input and checks for duplicate enrollments.

 2. Viewing Enrollments

Admin or students can view enrolled courses using a GET request.

For example:

view.php?student_id=1 â†’ shows all courses for that student.

 3. Admin Panel

Admin can add, edit, or delete courses in the admin.php page.

Courses stored in the courses table are reflected automatically in the enrollment form.

 4. Dashboard

The dashboard.php shows a summary of:

Total students

Total courses

Total enrollments.
